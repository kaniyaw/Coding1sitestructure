Enchant ME!

Mission:
•	Our mission is make women and men of all ages, colors, and sizes feel beautiful and loved.
•	We wish to make everyone feel accepted and proud of what they do.
•	We try to make all our prices reasonable and make all our product easily accessible.
•	We want to have a responsive website, so that it works effectively.

Web pages:
•	Only five of our web pages are complete the other few are not done because we do not know how to complete the following activities that need to be done.

•	When we updated our school computers, we had to figure out how to do an explorer webkit on our pages so our pictures and slide show would show up with no problem.

•	We didn’t have enough time to fix the images, which didn’t work for Microsoft edge, so we just updated it in chrome.

•	We’ve incorporated three slideshows to demonstrate our client’s talent and artistic color style.

•	We kept our color scheme the same with the baby blue and cotton candy pink to keep the same energy and not have our project look like a color wheel.

•	We made our logo, the enchant me image, to link back to the homepage and included it on every page.

•	We have yet to make our submit button link to something else on our sigh page for rewards.
